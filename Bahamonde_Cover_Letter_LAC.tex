% introduction
\vspace{-0.3cm}I am writing to apply for the position available in your institution. I am a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Inter-American Policy \& Research (CIPR) at Tulane University. I received my Ph.D. in political science from Rutgers University - New Brunswick in May 2017, where I studied under the direction of Robert Kaufman.


% teaching (topics) // service
As an {\bf instructor}, I am interested in courses that are carefully designed to answer big questions in comparative politics, not only from a Latin American perspective, but also across the broader spectrum. As a political economist, I mostly focus on economic development, economic history, institutional development and democratic development/underdevelopment. However, I am also interested in political participation, competitive authoritarianisms, welfare politics, party politics and other relevant topics. I would also feel very comfortable teaching both basic and advanced {\bf methods} courses. {\bf Service} to the department and its extended programs are one of my top priorities too. I firmly believe that being part of a teaching/research community requires active involvement from us. I am looking forward to do my part in this regard. {\bf Collaborative research with my students} is also another priority. For example, as an undergraduate student I worked very close with faculty members doing research. I learned so much outside of the classroom by doing research that it would \emph{not} be natural for me to not replicate my experience with my own students. At Rutgers, I always received excellent teaching evaluations. Please, \href{mailto:bahamondeh@gmail.com}{send me an email} to receive the most recent one, or let me know if you need teaching references.


% instructor: specifics
I have designed a very interesting syllabus to teach the \emph{Introduction to Comparative Politics} course. Comparative politics is both a substantive area and a scientific method. I take care of this distinction. Just to mention one example, when we discuss regime types I take the opportunity to teach the current debate on concept formation. I feel very passionate about concepts: \emph{What makes a democracy, a democracy? Is it elections? Both Cuba and China hold elections, however they are not fair. However, how can we measure `fair' elections?} Other topics such as democratic transitions/reversals and political culture are included as well. You can download the latest version of the syllabus \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Comparative_Politics_UGRAD/raw/master/Bahamonde_Comparative_Politics_Syllabus_UGRAD.pdf}{\texttt{here}}. I feel very passionate about political development too, and in general, I feel very intrigued about the question of why some countries succeed while others fail, in both economic and political terms. I have designed a very careful \emph{Introduction to Political Economy} syllabus where we examine in detail such a wide range of interesting topics. For example, we start by discussing the origins of democracy and the state, and later on in the semester I cover some topics on inequality and development. You can take a look at the latest version of my syllabus \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Political-Economy-Intro-UGrad/raw/master/Pol_Econ_Dev_Syllabus_UGRAD.pdf}{\texttt{here}}. Finally, in my course entitled \emph{Introduction to Latin American Politics} we discuss major political and economic challenges this very interesting region has faced. The latest syllabus is available \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Latin_American_Politics_UGRAD/raw/master/Bahamonde_Latin_American_Politics_Syllabus_UGRAD.pdf}{\texttt{here}}. I cannot finish this section without mentioning that I have a strong interest in political methodology and epistemology. My minor certification is in methodology. I would be very glad to teach both introductory and advanced courses on quantitative methodology.


% intro: my research in general
My {\bf research} explores the economic origins of state capacities as well as the political economy of institutional development and the role of inequality on democratic development. My methods include historical analyses, quantitative methods and experimental designs. While my research focuses predominantly on Latin America, my current and future research projects will be expanded to other developing countries.

% job market paper and working papers. 
My {\bf dissertation} argued that the structural transformation, i.e. the secular decline of agriculture and substantial expansion of manufacturing, imposed tight constraints on the way politics was run by the incumbent landowning class since the colonial period. I utilized fine-grained historical case study comparisons, sectoral outputs from 1900 to the present, time-series econometric techniques, hazard models, and a novel earthquake dataset that covers sub-national death tolls from 1900 to the present to measure state capacities. Using {\bf a novel dataset on historical earthquakes} to proxy state capacities, my {\bf job market} \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Earthquake_Paper/raw/master/Bahamonde_Earthquake_Paper.pdf}{\texttt{paper}} (\emph{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/RU/Dissertation/Papers/Earthquake_Paper/status.txt}\unskip}) explains that sectoral conflicts between the landed and industrial elites fostered inter-elite compromises that lead to higher levels of state capacities overtime. {\bf I extend these results in another} \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Negative_Link_Paper/raw/master/Bahamonde_NegativeLink.pdf}{\texttt{paper}} (\emph{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/RU/Dissertation/Papers/NegativeLink/status.txt}\unskip}) where I argue that the emergence of an efficient and productive industrial sector not only made unsustainable the political monopoly run by the landed elites changing the inter-sectoral balance of political power, but also altered the structure of the economy \emph{causing} economic growth. 


Additionally I am currently building on the findings of a series of {\bf working papers related to vote-buying and vote-selling}, using both observational and an original experimental dataset in the Americas. One of these papers discusses why parties target in a clientelistic way groups or individuals. You can download the latest version of the later (which is \emph{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/RU/research/Clientelism_paper/status.txt}\unskip}) \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Clientelism_paper/raw/master/Bahamonde_Clientelism_Paper.pdf}{\texttt{here}}.
