# Job Interviews

This is the material I have to memorize for my interviews.


## Dissertation

	- It's about state building in the context of developing countries, particularly in Latin America.

	- I start by arguing that fiscal capacities were the main "state-builder" institution.

		- Idea: early implementers of the income tax law were able to build early state institutions.

	- Mechanism: countries have endogenous incentives to implement this important institution when there is competition between two elites which are 

		1. invested in different sectors and 

		2. are about of about the same size. 

		Equality/Inequality: It is inter-elite equality what forces each sector to cooperate. When there is inter-elite inequality, i.e. when one sector dominates the economy (and in consequence, military and politically), there are no incentives to share power and make agreements.

	- Measurement: sectoral outputs from 1900 to the present on agricultural and industrial outputs to measure inter-elite competition.
	
	- The modernization of the fiscal apparatus was the product of an inter-elite competition process
	
	- between the agricultural and industrial classes. The dissertation is embedded into a larger book project, where I analyze how these structural transformations helped states to make institutional investments that lead to the formation of states with higher capacities. Using fine-grained historical case study comparisons, sectoral outputs from 1900 to the present, time-series econometric techniques and a novel earthquake dataset (to measure state capacities), I find that industrial elites challenged the traditional/agricultural sector, creating the incentives to self-impose state institutions.
