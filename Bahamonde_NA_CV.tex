% Bio
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Bio}

Dr. Hector Bahamonde, an Assistant Professor of Political Science (political economy), has a successful academic career in Chile. In 2017 he earned his PhD in the United States. Now, being 34 years old, he's trying to relocate to Germany, get a non-academic job, and {\bf make use of his methodological training and communication-interpersonal skills outside academia}. Today, he just wants to change subjects. That is, instead of studying the most-likely \emph{voter}, he wants to learn about the most-likely \emph{consumer}/\emph{debtor}. Married to a German woman, both want to improve their work/life balance, and spend more time with Tobias (2 years-old) and Olimpia (1 year-old).

\section*{Skills}


\subsection*{Certified Methods Proficiency}

I have graduate-level statistics training in forecasting, vector auto-regression and error correction models, Bayesian analyses, survey, laboratory and quasi experiments, linear and generalized statistical models, regression discontinuity and diff-in-diff designs. These certifications were obtained at the {\bf University of Michigan} (Ann Arbor), {\bf Princeton} and {\bf Rutgers} University (Statistics Msc programme). Below, I detail some of the courses I've taken:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] {\bf Forecasting}: ``Time Series,'' ``Advanced Time Series.''
	\item[-] {\bf Bayesian}: ``Introduction to Bayesian Analysis.'' 
	\item[-] {\bf Lineal Models}: ``Advanced Ordinary Least Square Methods,'' ``Regression Analysis.''
	\item[-] {\bf Non-lineal Models}: ``Advanced Maximum Likelihood-Estimation'' and ``Panel Data Analyses.''
	\item[-] {\bf Game Theory}: ``Introduction to Game Theory'' and ``Formal Modeling.''
	\item[-] {\bf Experimental Methods}: ``Experimental Methods,'' ``Causal Inference for the Social Sciences.''
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Data-Oriented and Computational Social Scientist}
My goal is to help you making data-informed decisions. 
I'm passionate about working with big datasets, designing and implementing metrics, building statistical models to learn about customer behavior, product usage, and communicating meaningful reports. You can check my modeling expertise in my \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde}{GitHub}. Teaching and presenting at conferences are my daily routine; I'm passionate about communicating results effectively too.







\subsection*{Interpersonal}
I have considerable experience as an independent critical person, used to work under pressure, and goal-oriented. Not only do I have good writing/analytical skills, but also excellent interpersonal relationships. Having both excellent leadership skills and willingness to collaborate with others, make me an ideal candidate to take different roles, for instance in different projects, in the same institution. 





\subsection*{Others}
\begin{itemize}
	\item- {\bf Languages}: English, Spanish.
	\item- {\bf Advanced Software Usage}: \texttt{R}, \texttt{Stata}, \LaTeX.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Career Objective}

I want to help institutions (big or small) to reach their goals by incorporating my academic experience. By bringing my analytical skills, and excellent interpersonal relationships, I am interested in both leading teams and collaborating with others. My ideal institution lets its employees be innovative, goal-oriented and creative. {\bf I have immediate availability, and I'm ready to relocate \emph{tomorrow}.}
