\vspace{-2cm}{\bf \huge Research Plan}\\

%\vspace{-1cm}

My research plan during my stay at your institution consists of following parts: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Publishing ongoing research I have been working on (more details below).
  \item Developing new research with faculty members, other post-docs and/or graduate students at your institution.
  \item Attending the main conferences in the discipline.
  \item Organizing a workshop/mini-conference per year at your institution.
  \item Also, I would be very happy: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Giving service to the Department/Institution.
      \item Teaching and/or advising graduate and/or undergraduate courses (please refer to my \href{http://github.com/hbahamonde/Job_Market/raw/master/Bahamonde_Teaching_Statement.pdf}{teaching statement}).
      \item Assuming administrative tasks when necessary (sitting in committees, organizing talks, etc.).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


{\bf Publishing ongoing research}. Within comparative politics, my research explores the intersection between inequality and political development, from a political economy perspective. I situate my research both in the ``structural'' and ``behavior'' paradigms. 

For the former, I intend to publish a chapter from my dissertation entitled ``\href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Earthquake_Paper/raw/master/Bahamonde_Earthquake_Paper.pdf}{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/Dissertation/Papers/Earthquake_Paper/title.txt}\unskip}.'' \input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/Dissertation/Papers/Earthquake_Paper/abstract.txt}\unskip 

For the latter, after publishing \href{https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/view/1121/1128}{\emph{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Clientelism_paper/status.txt}\unskip}} on Brazil and  \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41269-020-00174-4}{\emph{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Vote_Selling/status.txt}\unskip}} on the United States, I plan on continuing my scholarly work on clientelism and development. 

I have the following pieces of research in the ``pipeline.'' Please note that all these pieces analyze original data using state-of-the-art methodological techniques. All these papers are currently work in progress.

\begin{enumerate}

  % Andrea paper
  \item ``\href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Economic_Experiment_Vote_Selling/raw/master/Vote_Selling_Bahamonde_Canales_Paper.pdf}{{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Economic_Experiment_Vote_Selling/title.txt}\unskip}}.'' {\bf This is an economic experiment on clientelism}. {\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Economic_Experiment_Vote_Selling/abstract.txt}\unskip}

  % Cristobal paper
  \item ``\href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Conjoint_US/raw/master/Bahamonde_Quininao_Conjoint.pdf}{{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Conjoint_US/title.txt}\unskip}}.'' {\bf Using a novel dataset, I designed a conjoint experiment to test which democratic values should ``fail'' in order to produce vote-sellers}. {\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Conjoint_US/abstract.txt}\unskip}

  % Mart paper
  \item ``\href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Inequality_State_Capacity/raw/main/Bahamonde_Trasberg.pdf}{{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Inequality_State_Capacity/title.txt}\unskip}}.'' {\bf This paper's status is {\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Inequality_State_Capacity/status.txt}\unskip} and it looks at the relationship between inequality, democracy and state capacity}. {\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Inequality_State_Capacity/abstract.txt}\unskip}

  % Igor paper
  \item {\bf COVID and Inequality}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbahamonde/Tobalaba/main/abstract.txt}{Skyrocketed Inequality and (Un)lockdown Political Elites in Chile: Aerodrome Usage during Pandemic Times}. {\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Tobalaba/abstract.txt}\unskip}. 
      \item \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Bus/raw/main/abstract.txt}{The Bus of Inequality: Public Transportation and COVID in Santiago}. {\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Bus/abstract.txt}\unskip}. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


Given that I have made considerable progress in all these papers, I am sure they will be (well) published while spending time at your Institution.

{\bf Developing new research with faculty members, other post-docs and/or graduate students at your institution}. As you can see, I collaborate with colleagues from different disciplines, scholarly interests, genders, nationalities and degrees of seniority. Following this line, I will be very happy to collaborate with you and other colleagues. I am very sure I will have something interesting to bring to the table, both from a substantive and methodological aspects. {\bf I look forward to working and publishing with you!}

{\bf Reaching out}. Finally, during my time at your Institution, I will take very seriously attending the main conferences in the discipline and organizing a workshop/mini-conference per year at your institution. Every year, since grad school, I attend two to three conferences per year. I have also plenty of experiencing organizing seminars and mini-workshops.
