% bio and my research in general
I obtained my B.A. in Political Science at Catholic University of Chile. Then I received a full fellowship from Rutgers University to pursue my doctoral studies. After receiving my PhD in Political Science from Rutgers University-New Brunswick, NJ, U.S. in May 2017, I spent one year as a post-doctoral fellow at Tulane University-New Orleans, LA, U.S. {\bf My research explores the political economy of institutional development and the role of inequality on democratic development. My methods include historical analyses, quantitative/statistical and experimental methods.} I pay particularly attention to new ways of using digital information to construct natural experiments within the potential outcomes framework.
