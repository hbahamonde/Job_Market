% introduction
\vspace{-0.3cm}I am writing to apply for the position available at your institution. Currently, I am an assistant professor (tenure-track) at O$'$Higgins University, in Chile. Founded just in 2015, {\bf O$'$Higgins University is a public research-oriented institution}.
% bio
After receiving my PhD in Political Science from {\bf Rutgers University}-New Brunswick in May 2017---where I studied under the direction of Robert Kaufman---I spent one year as a post-doctoral fellow at {\bf Tulane University}. 


% intro: my research in general
My {\bf research} explores the economic and political origins of state capacities as well as the political economy of institutional development and the role of inequality on democratic development (clientelism). My methods include historical analyses, quantitative and experimental methods. While my research focuses predominantly on Latin America, my current and future research projects will be expanded to other developing and developed countries. A more detailed description of my scholarly work can be found in my \href{http://github.com/hbahamonde/Job_Market/raw/master/Bahamonde_Research_Statement.pdf}{\texttt{research statement}}.

{\bf Vote Buying.} I have {\bf published} the following piece, \emph{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Clientelism_paper/status.txt}\unskip}, on vote buying in Brazil. The paper starts by recognizing that there is not consensus on whether parties target groups or individuals. In fact, most scholars assume that group-targeting and individual-targeting are interchangeable. What seems to be a major problem, however, is that scholars seem to base their decision on their own research designs; ethnographers typically study how parties target \emph{individuals} while experimentalist scholars typically look at how parties target districts/municipalities/states (i.e. \emph{groups}). I developed and tested a theory where parties make use of simultaneous segmented targeting techniques. Groups are preferred by brokers when party machines need to secure higher levels of electoral support, relying on the economies of scale and spillover effects that these groups provide. However, individuals are better targets when they are more identifiable---that is when poor individuals are nested in non-poor contexts or vice-versa. Interestingly, I find that non-poor individuals are also targeted. The paper uses observational data, matching methods and a short case study (Brazil).


{\bf Vote Selling.} With the support of a generous grant, I designed two experiments in the U.S. out of a series of experiments to be fielded in Latin America for further comparison. In this published \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Vote_Selling/raw/master/Bahamonde_VoteSellingUS.pdf}{\texttt{piece}} (\emph{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Vote_Selling/status.txt}\unskip}) I looked at the issue of vote selling in the US. \input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/research/Vote_Selling/abstract.txt}.

Within the same project, I am currently designing an {\bf economic experiment about vote selling and vote buying}. By implementing an ``auction game'' in the lab, the experiment recreates market conditions that exist between vote buyers and vote sellers. See more details in my \href{http://github.com/hbahamonde/Job_Market/raw/master/Bahamonde_Research_Statement.pdf}{\texttt{research statement}}.


% papers
In addition to my published work, I am working on a book manuscript. Using {\bf a novel dataset on historical earthquakes} to proxy state capacities, I have a \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/Earthquake_Paper/raw/master/Bahamonde_Earthquake_Paper.pdf}{\texttt{working paper}} (\emph{\input{/Users/hectorbahamonde/Dissertation/Papers/Earthquake_Paper/status.txt}\unskip}) explains that sectoral conflicts between the landed and industrial elites fostered inter-elite compromises that lead to higher levels of state capacities over time. The book seeks to analyze how economic structural transformations in Latin America helped states to make institutional investments that lead to the formation of states with higher capacities. I leverage fine-grained historical case study comparisons, sectoral economic outputs from 1900 to the present, time-series econometric techniques, hazard models, and a novel earthquake dataset that covers sub-national death tolls from 1900 to the present to measure state capacities. This project builds on the fiscal sociology literature and the dual-sector economy model. 


% agenda: structure / behavior
As a comparativist and political economist, I believe that advanced methods should be used to answer big questions. In this sense, my research also has a disciplinary agenda. My scholarly work, for example tries to examine classic problems in comparative political development (e.g. state capacities, clientelism, etc.), while at the same time incorporating cutting-edge econometric and experimental techniques. Similarly, my working papers and experiments, are concerned with fundamental questions regarding democratic theory.
