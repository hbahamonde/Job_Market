\f0\fs24 \cf0 My research studies the relationship between economic inequality and support for democracy. In particular, I\'92m interested in the threshold that flips pro-democracy individuals into pro-authoritarian individuals. My methods include experimental (lab and survey) and quantitative (statistical) techniques. In the context of prospect theory, I develop experiments that test the amount of losses that changes people\'92s attitudes toward democracy.}
